                5 Most Popular Mumbai Islands
            </h2>

            <h3>
                1. Isle of Bombay
            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>The long stretch between the town of Dongri and the Malabar Hills was previously known as the Isle of Bombay.</b> Formerly used as a <u>hub of the British marina</u> because of its strategic positioning in the Arabic Sea, the isle currently houses numerous historical places and landmarks. Among these, the Banganga Tank, the Hanging Garden, and the Waklakeshwar temple are some of the notable names. Besides visiting these places, you can also go on a shopping date with your girlfriend or wife. This place is especially popular for regale boutiques, which you can buy as souvenirs.

            <h3>
                2. Mazagaon
            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>The name of the Mazagaon Island was derived from the term Matsya Gram, which, in English, means the Fishing Village.</b> Mainly inhabited by the Portuguese fishermen during the 16th century, the island of Mazagaon is one of the most popular harbor ports in India. Located on the northern side of the metropolis of Mumbai, Mazagaon still holds various traces of the Portuguese culture. If you are visiting here for the first time and want to relish the age-old Portuguese essence, then make sure to visit the Our Lady of Rosery’s Church here.

Apart from Portuguese architectural pieces, <u>this part of Mumbai also houses numerous other things,</u> such as the Chinese Temple and Mausoleum of Mazagaon. If you are coming here for the first time, then the Mausoleum of Mazagaon is must-visit for you as it has an uncanny resemblance to the Taj Mahal.

            <h3>
                3. Colaba And Old Woman’s Island
            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>Located on the southern side of the city of Mumbai,</b> the Colaba and Old Woman’s Island is considered to be the most beautiful among the seven islands of Mumbai. Like the Mazagaon islet, this one, too, was the home of fishermen in the 16th century. During that time, the isle was known as the island of Kolis. However, after the Portuguese people took over this islet, they changed its name to Candil Island.

                This part of Mumbai is mainly known for <u>housing some of the best and most famous hotels in India.</u> Among them, the Taj Mahal Hotel Palace is one of the most notable names. Apart from these, you can also spend your time here by roaming around some of the other attractions of this section. However, if you really want to enjoy your time around here, then make sure to check out the night bars of this place.

                4. Worli Island
            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>Known for being extremely famous among the history-aficionados,</b> the place where the Worli Island was situated before, houses a lot of famous architectural structures. Among these, the Heritage Fort is known to be a highlight of the region. Apart from the historic places, this section of the city of Mumbai is also quite famous among the tourists because of showcasing one of the most elegant skylines in India. In terms of luxuriousness and lavishness too, this part of the metropolis is known to be the best among the 7 islands of Mumbai.

As mentioned before, <u>the most highlighting part of this section of Mumbai is its skyline.</u> So, if you are traveling here for the first time, then make sure to savor the heavenly essence of the sunset through the Worli skyline.

                5. Mahim Island
            </h3>
            <p>

                <b>Situated towards the North-east side of Worli,</b> the island of Mahim was known to be the capital of Mumbai in the 13th century, when it was under the rule of Raja Bhimdev. However, during the 14th century, the Sultan of Gujarat captured this island from Raja Bhimdev and made numerous mosques and dargahs here. Among these, the Makhdoom Ali Mahimi shrine is known to be the most popular among the tourists.

Apart from these architectural beauties, <u>place is also famous for yet another thing, which is the Mahim Causeway.</u> This prolonged route connects this part of Mumbai with the isle of Salsette.
